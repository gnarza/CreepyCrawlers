# :skull::bug: Creepy Crawlers :bug::skull:
A de-make/remake of the Funbrain Creepy Crawlers game I used to play in elementary school (link down below). Basically a Snake and Pac-man fusion.
In this game the idea is that food-stressed caterpillars resort to cannibalism. The objective is to eat shorter opponents and also other bugs on the map in order to grow your tail to a certain length to go to the next level. This is how the player will be able to survive long enough to become a butterfly.

## Getting Started :floppy_disk:
---
To play the game you can download the .html or look under the mygame.bin folder for your OS to get to version of this game and run the file.

If you would like to look at the code you may open the .p8 file and look through it, though the only way to test it yourself is to download the Pico-8 software and run/edit from there. (Link to Pico-8 down below)

## Running Tests :clapper:
